Web page for the Fashion dataset introduced in the BMVC2019 paper "DwNet: Dense warp-based network for pose-guided human video generation".
Here is our demo video for both Fashion dataset and Taichi:

To obtain the [train data](resources/fashion_dataset/fashion_train.txt) and the [test data](resources/fashion_dataset/fashion_test.txt) you need to run the [script](resources/fashion_dataset/data_crowler.py) from the same directory where you put the above files.
